1.  Introduction

   The main ideas had emerged while thinking about context-aware
   services and trying to find answers to the following questions:

      How can a framework connect communication partners with matching
      communication interests and context?

      How can it be open for all types of interests and context?

      How can it be organized to maximize the availabilty of the
      service?

      How can it be organized to minimize the customizing effort for its
      clients?

   Due to the lack of an useful clear distinction between the terms
   information and context, Contextinformation (CI) shall be defined as
   information within its described context, i.e. context becomes part
   of CI by describing it.  This described CI has to be converted into a
   general format, in which the initial meaning is not relevant to find
   matching CI.

   Contextinformation Coding (CIC) is that conversion and CIC means
   both, an encoding resp. decoding ruleset (CIC-Ruleset) for a
   particular type of CI and an concrete piece of encoded CI.  Every CIC
   has an identifier, called CIC-Number.  A CIC-Ruleset and all its
   encoded CI are linked by this CIC-Number.  Encoded CI has the form of
   a bit string, named CI-Content, and is one half of a pair of bit
   strings.  The other half of the encoded CI, named CI-Mask, is used to
   define the accuracy of the searched match.  Then it is sufficient for
   a bitwise match of two pieces of CI, if both CI-Contents are equal or
   both CI-Masks mark them as non-relevant.

   Let me illustrate this with an example.  Offer and Request are two
   communication roles, and location is a type of CI.  Offer says "I'm
   available for any Request with matching CI to contact me" and Request
   says "I'm searching for any Offer with matching CI".  Both have an
   exact information about their location and can define a surrounding
   area where Offer is available respectively Request is searching.  CI-
   Content, as the encoded location, together with CI-Mask defines the
   surrounding area by marking bits of CI-Content as true in any case
   concerning the match.  Here the CI of Offer and Request are matching,
   if the location of one is in the surrounding area of the other and
   vice versa.

   Encoded CI is encapsulated in a datastructure named
   Contextinformation Packet (CIP).  A CIP is divided into three parts:

   o  Header Data

   o  Contextinformation

   o  Client Data

   All information which has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be
   encapsulated within CIPs.  CIP were created by client applications
   originally and send into a CRN.

   Contextinformation Routing (CIR) takes place in an overlay network
   built normally on top of the TCP/IP layer.  It is organized by using
   CI-Content as index.  It is oriented towards known concepts of
   network routing and others network principles as well as B-tree like
   datastructures.

2.  Motivation

   The motivation for this RFC is to .

3.  Contextinformation Coding (CIC)

   Contextinformation Coding (CIC), i.e. a CIC-Ruleset, defines an
   injective function between a set of CI and a set of permutations of a
   bit string (CI-Content) with a fixed byte length, i.e. there is
   exactly one bit string for every described content of the CIC-
   Ruleset.  CI-Mask, the second bit string, is not defined individually
   by the CIC-Ruleset.  CI-Masks are not part of the CIC-Ruleset, but
   can be seen as part of encoded CI.

3.1.  Internal Structure

   The internal structure of CIC is self-referential.  This means an
   encoded CI can be part of other encoded CI and can contain other
   encoded CI.  Likewise a CIC-Ruleset can be part of other CIC-Rulesets
   and can contain other CIC-Rulesets.  A CIC needs at least one CIC-
   Number and additionally every exchangable internal CIC needs one CIC-
   Number for each possible CIC.  A CIC, not containing other CICs, is
   called CIC-Module.  The outermost CIC is called a Root-CIC.  A Root-
   CIC can be part of another CIC.  There it is no longer a Root-CIC.

3.1.1.  CIC-Brick

   Encoded CI consists of a pair of bit strings with its length rounded
   up to the next byte.  One of these byte pairs is called a CIC-Brick.
   One byte string is named CI-Content and the other is named CI-Mask.
   CI-Content stands either for encoded CI or for a CIC-Number.  One
   CIC-Brick can contain more than one items, i.e. encoded CI and CIC-
   Numbers.  The Root-CIC must have a length rounded up to the next byte
   lately.

             Figure 1.1.1 shows the structure of a CIC-Brick.

   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8
   + ----+---- +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |                  CI-Content                   |
   + ----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |                   CI-Mask                     |
   + ----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   The calculation of a match between two CI-Bricks uses the following
   function resp. bitwise expression:

   match(Offer, Request) = ( NOT ( Offer-Content XOR Request-Content ) )
   OR ( Offer-Mask AND Request-Mask )

3.1.2.  CIC-Number

   Every CIC-Ruleset and all its encoded CI have an individual CIC-
   Number in common.  In general a CIC-Number can be well-known or
   temporary.  The CIC-Numbers of the Root-CICs must be well-known and
   they are part of the Contextinformation Packet specification (CIP-
   Specification).

3.1.3.  CIC-Spam

   CIC-Spam describes bits of a CIC which have no meaning.  This refers
   to CI-Content and, more frequent, to CI-Mask.  CIC-Spam can be used
   for other purposes theoretically.

3.1.4.  Limitations

   Contextinformation Packet (CIP) defines a maximum number of CI-
   Bricks.  But a CIC can use an unlimited number of CIPs in a row.
   Here, related to one CIP, the end point of the Contextinformation
   Routing (CIR), i.e. the matching communication partner, is the start
   point for the next CIR, related to the next CIP, and so on.  Seen
   from another perspective, every CIP lives in its own
   Contextinformation Routing Network (CRN) with its own CICs.  There
   the CIC finds its route through these CRNs.

3.2.  CIC's Application Types

   It is not specified how CI or CIC should look like.  But some aspects
   shall be introduced here:

   Changebility, i.e. from a static CIC to permanent updatable CIC-
   Ruleset.




Stefan Hans               Expires June 3, 2016                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Contextinformation Routing Networks     December 2015


   Clarity, i.e. how protected is encoded CI especially the CIC-Number
   from being misinterpreted.

   Availability, i.e. CI can be hidden by using CIC-Spam as an unique
   identifier only known by certain communication partners.

   Degree of linkage to the application, e.g. the CIC is simply a unique
   identifier of the application or the CIC has no knowing about an
   application at all.

3.3.  Deployment of CIC-Rulesets

   CRNs provide an infrastructure for CIC-Rulesets.  This can, but must
   not, be used for distributing CIC-Rulesets.  Any other way is
   possible according to the intended availability.

3.4.  Emergence and Future Use

   Due to the simple basic principles, the broad applicability and the
   unrestricted length of CI, the resulting codings and the applications
   using them can not be foreseen, provided that CRNs will be used
   numerously.  The resulting emergence is probably the key aspect of
   CRNs.  Even the main application principles of today are possibly not
   complete or major relevant ones are missing still.  Therefore the
   specifications leave room for future use.

4.  Contextinformation Packet (CIP)

   For the concepts of the CIP's main parts see the following sections.
   For detailed CIP specification see Internet-Draft "Contextinformation
   Paket (CIP) Specification for Contextinformation Routing Networks
   (CRNs)" [CIP_Spec].

4.1.  Header Data

   The header data concern all metadata not directly related to CIC.
   The header data starts with a part with fixed size and static
   structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static part defines the
   dynamic part's type and its length.

4.2.  Contextinformation

   The Contextinformation part has leading bytes to specify the type and
   one byte for the number of CI-Bricks following.  A CI-Brick is pair
   of bit strings with a length of one byte, i.e. one byte CI-Content
   linked with one byte of CI-Mask.  The type specified by the first
   bytes is like a meta or root CIC-Number and is mainly free for future
   use.

Internet-Draft     Contextinformation Routing Networks     December 2015


4.3.  Client Data

   The client data starts with a part with fixed size and static
   structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static part only defines
   the dynamic part's type and its length.

5.  Contextinformation Routing (CIR)

   For the main concepts of the CIR see the following sections.  For
   detailed CIR specification see Internet-Draft "Contextinformation
   Routing (CIR) Specification for Contextinformation Routing Networks
   (CRNs)" [CIR_Spec].

5.1.  Overlay Network

   CIR can be build on any digital network.  Especially internet,
   intranets and peer-to-peer networks on the TCP/IP layer.

5.2.  Encoded CI Routing

   This routing is oriented on the CI-Bricks using CI-Content as index.
   If a bit of CI-Mask is true, the routing will be split to follow both
   pathes of the indexing.

5.3.  Client's Network Address Updates

   To optimize the availibility of the clients in volatile networks,
   e.g. mobile devices in the internet, CRNs have a procedure to check
   the availability the clients' address information and the clients
   have a procedure to update these.

5.4.  CIC-Ruleset Request Routing

   Similar to the encoded CI routing CRNs provide an infrastructure to
   store and retrieve CIC-Rulesets.

5.5.  Metadata

   CRNs communicate aggregations and other metadata, if asked for or if
   the resultset of matching CI is too large.
