1.  Introduction

   The main ideas had emerged while thinking about Context Aware
   Services and trying to find answers to the following questions:

      How can a framework connect communication partners with matching
      communication interests and context?

      How can it be open for new types of interests and context to
      anybody?

      How can it be organized to maximize the availabilty of the service
      and to minimize the customizing effort for its clients?

Internet-Draft     Contextinformation Routing Networks     December 2015


   In an attempt at a definition of information and context it has
   turned out that there is no useful clear distinction between the two.
   Thus the term of Contextinformation (CI) means information within its
   described context, i.e. context becomes part of CI by describing it.

   Here the universal approach to find matching CI is that each kind of
   CI has to be encoded as bit string individually.  Contextinformation
   Coding (CIC) means both, an encoding resp. decoding protocol (CIC-
   Protocol) for a particular type of CI and an concrete piece of
   encoded CI.  Every CIC has a unique identifier, called CIC-Number.  A
   CIC-Protocol and all its encoded CI are linked by a unique CIC-
   Number.  Encoded CI in the form of a bit string, named CI-Content, is
   one half of a pair of bit strings.  The other half of the encoded CI,
   named CI-Mask, is used to define the accuracy of the searched match.
   Then it is sufficient for a match, if CI-Content is equal or both CI-
   Masks mark them as non-relevant.

   Let me illustrate this with an example.  Offer and Request are two
   communication roles, and location is a type of CI.  Offer says "I'm
   available for any Request witch matching CI to contact me" and
   Request says "I'm searching for any Offer with matching CI".  Both
   have an exact information about their location and can define a
   surrounding area where Offer is available respectively Request is
   searching.  CI-Content, as encoded location CI, defines with CI-Mask
   the surrounding area by marking a bit of CI-Content as true in any
   case concerning the match.  This has the consequence that the
   location is always included in the surrounding area.  Here the CI of
   Offer and Request are matching, if the exact location of one is in
   the surrounding area of the other and vice versa.

   Encoded CI is encapsulated in a datastructure named
   Contextinformation Packet (CIP).  It is divided in three parts:

   o  Header Data

   o  Contextinformation

   o  Client Data

   All information which has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be
   encapsulated within CIPs.  CIP were created by client applications
   originally and send into a CRN.

   Contextinformation Routing (CIR) takes place in an overlay network
   built normally on top of the TCP/IP layer.  It is organized by using
   CI-Content as index and represents a virtual tree of CICs.  It is
   oriented towards known concepts of network routing and others network
   concepts.

2.  Contextinformation Coding (CIC)

   A CIC-Protocol defines an injective function between a set of CI and
   a set of permutations of a bit string with a fixed byte length (CI-
   Content), i.e. there is exactly one bit string for every described
   content of the CIC-Protocol.  Every CIC-Protocol and all its encoded
   CI have an individual CIC-Numbers.  In general a CIC-Number can be
   well-known or temporary.  Every network can have its own CIC-Numbers.
   This aspect is comparable with port numbers.  CI-Mask, the second bit
   string, is not defined individually by the CIC-Protocol.  CI-Masks
   are not part of the CIC-Protocol, but can be seen as part of encoded
   CI.  In this regard one bit of a CI-Mask may enlarge or double the
   matching CI-Content permutations.

   Furthermore, CIC definitions can use other CIC definitions like in a
   hierarchical tree.  The leaves of this tree are called CIC-Modules.
   CRNs provides routing infrastructure of encoded CI and CIC-Protocol
   definitions as well.

   Although encoded CI is limited to 255 byte per packet (CIP), it is
   theoretically unlimited because it can be spread over different
   packets limitless.

2.1.  Structure

   A CIC can be part of other CICs and can contain other CICs.  All
   together it builds a complex hierarchical tree.  A CIC, which does
   not contain other CICs, represents a leave of the CIC-Tree and is
   called a CIC-Module.

2.1.1.  CIC-Bricks

   CIC consists of a pair of bit strings with its length rounded up to
   the next byte.  One of these byte pair is called a CIC-Brick.  One
   byte string is named CI-Content and the other is named CI-Mask.  CI-
   Content stands either for encoded CI or for a CIC-Number.  Depending
   on the CIC type not every combination of bits of a CI-Mask makes
   sense.  For a CIC-Number CI-Mask has no meaning so far.  These
   meaningless bits respectively combinations of bits are called CIC-
   Spam.

2.2.  Types of CIC-Modules

   The main differentiating features of the CIC types are the following:

   Relation between defined and possible permutations
                  (1:2) A binary CIC-Module, e.g. female or male.
                  (1:n) A linear list as CIC-Module, e.g. age.

                  (n:m) A set as CIC-Module, e.g. interests.



   Complexity of CIC structure
                  The complexity increases with the number of nodes of
                  the CIC-Tree.



   Coding function
                  Explicit mapping or calculating functions.



2.3.  Distinction and Deployment

   CIC contains of CI-Bricks

3.  Contextinformation Packet (CIP)

   For the concepts of the CIP's main parts see the following sections.
   For detailed CIP specification see Internet-Draft "Contextinformation
   Paket (CIP) Specification for Contextinformation Routing Networks
   (CRNs)" [CIP_Spec].

3.1.  Header Data

   The header data start with a part with fixed size and static
   structure followed by a dynamic part.  The dynamic part starts with
   two bytes defining the type and the length of the following dynamic
   part.

3.2.  Contextinformation

   The Contextinformation part has leading bytes to specify the type and
   one byte for the number of CI-Bricks following.  A CI-Brick is pair
   of bit strings with a length of one byte, i.e. one byte CI-Content
   linked with one byte of CI-Mask.  The type specified by the first
   bytes is like a meta or root CIC-Number and is mainly free for future
   use.

3.3.  Client Data

   The client data part has leading two bytes.  One byte for type of
   client data and one byte for the number of bytes following.
