  Contextinformation Paket (CIP) Specification for Contextinformation
                        Routing Networks (CRNs)
                       CIP Specification for CRNs

Abstract

   Contextinformation Paket (CIP) is the datastructure to transfer
   contextinformation plus header and possibly application data through
   Contextinformation Routing Networks (CRNs).  All information which
   has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be encapsulated within CIPs.
   This document is the specification of CIP.  For an overview about
   CRNs please see document Contextinformation Routing Networks [CRNs].

1.  Introduction

   The main ideas had emerged while thinking about Context Aware
   Services and trying to find answers to the following questions:

      How can an open standard connect communication partners having
      matching communication interests and context?

      How can it be open for any kind of new definitions of interests
      and context to anybody?

      How can it be organized to maximize the availabilty of the service
      and to minimize the customizing effort for its clients?

   In an attempt of a definition of information and context it has
   turned out that there is no useful clear distinction between the two.
   The term of Contextinformation (CI) shall cover both aspects of
   information in this document.

   Now let me introduce two communication roles, i.e. Offer and Request,
   and location as an example for a CI.  Offer says "I'm available for
   anybody to contact me" and Request says "I am only looking for in the
   first place".  Both have a quite exact information about their
   location and can define an surrounding area where Offer is available
   respectively Request is searching.  If the exact location is not
   outside the surrounding area, it is defined as directly related.
   Provided that, these aspects of CI are named CI-Content (exact
   location) and CI-Mask (surrounding area).  This is essential for the
   understanding of the concept of CI.  The CI of Offer and Request are
   matching, in this case, if the exact location of one is in the
   surrounding area of the other and vice versa.  Then Offer's CI,
   including contact information, will be send to Request and possibly
   Request contacts Offer directly.

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs          December 2015


   One could now determine a specification for this purpose as one
   example of CI.  Let me introduce the concept of Contextinformation
   Coding (CIC) instead.  CIC means both a definition of an encoding
   resp. decoding protocol for a particular kind of CI and an encoded
   concrete piece of CI.  For unambiguity the terms "CIC-Protocol" and
   "encoded CI" will be used in this document, if needed.  A CIC-
   Protocol and all its encoded CI is linked by a CIC-Number.  Applied
   to our location based example we would determine a specification for
   this purpose, call it a CIC and assign a free CIC-Number to it.  Then
   all encoded CI is processed directly by the same algorithm to find
   matching CI, i.e. without an idea of the certain meaning of the used
   CIC.  Therefore CI will be encoded in a pair of bit strings
   representing CI-Content and CI-Mask.  Looking at one bit then it is
   sufficient for a match, if CI-Content is equal or both CI-Masks mark
   them as non-relevant.  Then a performant bitwise operation can be
   executed to find matching CI.

   A Contextinformation Packet (CIP) is the datastructure to encapsulate
   contextinformation and other data and divided in three parts:

   o  Header

   o  Contextinformation

   o  Data

   The Contextinformation Routing takes place in an overlay network
   built normally on top of the TCP/IP layer.  It is oriented towards
   known concepts of network routing and others more.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Format of datagrams containing context information.  Field sizes are
    given in octets.  Unless otherwise specified, fields contain binary
    integers, in normal Internet order with the most-significant octet
                first.  Each tick mark represents one bit.

2.1.  Elements

   sg_request
                  The Service Groups Request shows the relevant
                  service_groups requested by the datagram.  The
                  services which are requested by this datagram have the
                  appropriate bit switched on (see figure 2.1.2).

   sg_profile
                  The Service Groups Profile shows all available service
                  groups of the sender of this datagram.  The services
                  which are available have the appropriate bit switched
                  on (see figure 2.1.2).

   version
                  The version of this specification.  It has a higher
                  4-bit part which represents the major number and a
                  lowere 4-bit part which represents the minor number.

   channel
                  The channel can be used to separate context packet
                  traffic in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.

                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values have no meaning so far.

   UUID
                  The UUID is the unique identifier for the CIP.

   IP address
                  A 32-bit IP address in Network Byte Order.

   IP port
                  A 16-bit port number in Network Byte Order.

   time
                  Unix time of datagram introduction, i.e. the number of
                  seconds between 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 and the
                  moment the CIP arrived in the CRN for the first time.

   add_type
                  The type of the following data of the datagram.  The
                  value for the core functionality is 1 which has to be
                  used at the moment.  The value 0 is reserved for
                  testing and all other values have no meaning so far.

   add_size
                  The size of the following header data of the datagram,
                  i.e. the number of bytes.

   additional data
                  The additional data as specified in type and size.
                  The data for the core functionality is the service_id
                  which has to be used at the moment (see 2.1.2).

2.2.  Service Groups

   'Service Groups' describes the role(s) in the Context Network.

   Figure 2.1.2 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2  ---------------------------------------   8
   +---------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
   | client  | gateway |           not yet defined                  |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

     Thus the integer 1 means 'client', 2 means 'gateway' and 3 means
                                   both.

3.  Contextinformation

       Figure 2.2.1 shows the context (brick) section of the context
    datagram.  A context brick consists of two bytes: content und mask.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   | .............. additional data up to 510 bytes .............  | opt
   | .............. i.e. up to 255 context bricks  ..............  | |
   | ............................................................  | |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Format of datagrams containing context information.  Field sizes are
    given in octets.  Unless otherwise specified, fields contain binary
    integers, in normal Internet order with the most-significant octet
                                  first.

   type
                  The type can be used to specify different context
                  designs in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.
                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values has no meaning so far.

   content
                  The content is the first part of a Context Brick (see
                  section 2.4).  It is used in the core functionality to
                  specify the kind of context coding.

   mask
                  The mask is the second part of a Context Brick (see
                  section 2.4).  It is not used in the core
                  functionality so far.

   add_size
                  The number of Context Bricks as additional data (up to
                  255).

   additional data
                  The additional data contains the number of Context
                  Bricks (see section 2.4) as specified in add_size.

4.  Data

   The following figure shows the data section of the context datagram.
     This section has no meaning for the Context Routing itself.  The
    meaning of this section is only relevant to the clients.  Therefore
      the following structure has to be seen as a default and can be
     changed, if another specification is agreed between the concerned
   clients.  The 'add_size' has to be as if the default structure would
         be actual, i.e. available is then 'add_size + 141' bytes.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   |                          text (140)                           | fix
   |                                                               | |

   | ............................................................  | |
   | ........ additional data up to 255 bytes (add_size) ........  | opt
   | ............................................................  | |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Format of datagrams containing context information.  Field sizes are
    given in octets.  Unless otherwise specified, fields contain binary
    integers, in normal Internet order with the most-significant octet
   first.  Each tick mark represents one bit.  The area for 'text (140)'
                     does not correspond to 140 bytes.

   add_size
                  The size of additional data in bytes.

   text_type
                  The meaning or format of the following text, e.g.
                  plain text, URL.

   text
                  A fixed sized text, that means it has possibly to be
                  padded by blanks up to 140 characters.

   additional data
                  Any data in a size as specified by 'add_size', i.e.
                  limited by 255.

5.  Context Bricks

   A Context Brick is a pair of bytes in particular content and mask.
   It describes a piece of information and the relevance of its
   exactness.  The meaning of the Context Bricks is not known by the
   Context Network.

   content
                  The content represents an exact information encoded in
                  a byte.

   mask
                  The mask represents the relevance of the exactness of
                  the content in a byte.  For that a 1 makes the
                  corresponding bit of the content irrelevant.  Two bits
                  are corresponding, if they are at the same place in
                  the byte.
