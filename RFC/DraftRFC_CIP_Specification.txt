                       CIP Specification for CRNs

Abstract

   Contextinformation Paket (CIP) is the datastructure to transfer
   contextinformation plus header and possibly application data through
   Contextinformation Routing Networks (CRNs).  All information which
   has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be encapsulated within CIPs.
   This document is the specification of CIP.  For an overview about
   CRNs please see Internet-Draft "Concepts of Contextinformation
   Routing Networks (CRNs)" [CRNs].

1.  Introduction

   Contextinformation Packet (CIP) is the datastructure to encapsulate
   encoded Contextinformation (CI).  A CIP is divided into three parts:

   Header Data
             The header data contains metadata and specifies, among
             other things, how the data of the following two parts has
             to be interpreted.  The header data starts with a part of
             fixed size and static structure followed by a dynamic part.
             The static part defines also the dynamic part's type and
             its length.

   Contextinformation
             The Contextinformation starts with a part of fixed size and
             static structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static
             part defines also the dynamic part's type and its length.
             The dynamic part consists of CIC-Bricks only.



   Application Data
             The application data starts with a part of fixed size and
             static structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static
             part defines only the dynamic part's type and its length.



   All information which has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be
   encapsulated within CIPs.

2.  Motivation

   The motivation for this document is mainly the publication to prevent
   proprietary rights of third parties hindering the general
   availability of its described concepts.  Another additional
   motivation is the exchange with interested experts.  This draft is a
   first step towards a possible formal recognition as an Internet
   Standard in the future.

3.  Binary Representations of Elements

   Ordered Numbering
                  These elements show unsigned integers, e.g. from 0 to
                  255 (see figure 1).

   Flags
                  These elements show one flag per bit (see figure 2).

   Combinations
                  The representations of ordered numbering and bitwise
                  flags can be combined freely within elements.

   Well Known Representations
                  These representations are well known as standards like
                  IP address, port number, UUID etc..

   Reserved Zero Value (RZV)
                  Nearly all of the not well known representations have
                  the so called Reserved Zero Value.  That means zero as
                  value is reserved for developing and testing purposes.

4.1.  Fix Sized Header Data Elements

   request (RZV)
                  The Service Groups Request shows the relevant
                  service_groups requested by the datagram.  The
                  services which are requested by this datagram have the
                  appropriate bit switched on (see figure 4).

   profile (RZV)
                  The Service Groups Profile shows all available service
                  groups of the sender of this datagram.  The services
                  which are available have the appropriate bit switched
                  on (see figure 2.1.2).

   version (RZV)
                  The version of this specification.  It has a higher
                  4-bit part which represents the major number and a
                  lowere 4-bit part which represents the minor number.

   channel (RZV)
                  The channel can be used to separate context packet
                  traffic in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.
                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values have no meaning so far.

   UUID
                  The UUID is the unique identifier for the CIP.

   IP address
                  A 32-bit IP address in Network Byte Order.

   IP port
                  A 16-bit port number in Network Byte Order.

   time
                  Unix time of datagram introduction, i.e. the number of
                  seconds between 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 and the
                  moment the CIP arrived in the CRN for the first time.

   type (RZV)
                  The type of the following data of the datagram.  The
                  value for the core functionality is 1 which has to be
                  used at the moment.  The value 0 is reserved for
                  testing and all other values have no meaning so far.

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs          December 2015


                  The size of the following header data of the datagram,
                  i.e. the number of bytes.

   additional data
                  The additional data as specified in type and size.
                  The data for the core functionality is the service_id
                  which has to be used at the moment (see 2.1.2).

4.2.  Enumerations for Fixed Sized Header Data Elements

4.2.1.  Service Groups

   'Service Groups' describes the role(s) in CRNs.

     Figure 4 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2         3  ------------------------------  8
   +---------+---------+---------|----------------------------------+
   | gateway | router  | storage |         not yet defined          |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

   Thus the integer 1 means 'gateway', 2 means 'router' and 3 means both
                               and so forth.

4.2.2.  Channels

   'channel' describes the separated channels in CRNs.

     Figure 4 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2  ---------------------------------------   8
   +---------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
   | heartbeat  | routing | application           not yet defined   |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

     Thus the integer 1 means 'client', 2 means 'gateway' and 3 means
                                   both.

4.3.  Dynamically Sized Header Data Elements

   type (RZV)
                  The type of the following data of the datagram.  The
                  value for the core functionality is 1 which has to be
                  used at the moment.  The value 0 is reserved for
                  testing and all other values have no meaning so far.

                  The size of the following header data of the datagram,
                  i.e. the number of bytes.

   additional data
                  The additional data as specified in type and size.
                  The data for the core functionality is the service_id
                  which has to be used at the moment (see 2.1.2).

4.4.  Additional Header Data Types

   The types of additional header data are not yet specified.

5.  Contextinformation

       Figure 2.2.1 shows the context (brick) section of the context
    datagram.  A context brick consists of two bytes: content und mask.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   | .............. i.e. up to 255 CIC-Bricks  ..................  | |
   | ............................................................  | |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Field sizes, shown in brackets, are given in bytes.  Dots are used to
                     show the dynamically sized part.

5.1.  Fixed Sized Contextinformation Elements

   type (RZV)
                  The type can be used to specify different context
                  designs in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.
                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values has no meaning so far.

   root-CIC (RZV)
                  The mask is the second part of a Context Brick (see
                  section 2.4).  It is not used in the core
                  functionality so far.

   size
                  The number of Context Bricks as additional data (up to
                  255).

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs          December 2015


   additional data
                  The additional data contains the number of Context
                  Bricks (see section 2.4) as specified in size.

5.2.  Enumerations for Fixed Sized Contextinformation Elements

5.2.1.  Types

   'type' describes the very main types of contextinformation in CRNs.

5.2.2.  Root-CIC

   The usage of Root-CIC, i.e. CIC-Content and CIC-Mask, depends on
   'type' and is not yet finally decided.

5.3.  Dynamically Sized Contextinformation

   A Context Brick is a pair of bytes in particular content and mask.
   It describes a piece of information and the relevance of its
   exactness.  The meaning of the Context Bricks is not known by the
   Context Network.

   content
                  The content represents an exact information encoded in
                  a byte.

   mask
                  The mask represents the relevance of the exactness of
                  the content in a byte.  For that a 1 makes the
                  corresponding bit of the content irrelevant.  Two bits
                  are corresponding, if they are at the same place in
                  the byte.

   The following figure shows the data section of the context datagram.
     This section has no meaning for the Context Routing itself.  The
    meaning of this section is only relevant to the clients.  Therefore
      the following structure has to be seen as a default and can be
     changed, if another specification is agreed between the concerned
    clients.  The 'size' has to be as if the default structure would be
            actual, i.e. available is then 'size + 141' bytes.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   | .......... additional data up to 255 bytes (size) ..........  | dyn
   | ............................................................  | |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Field sizes, shown in brackets, are given in bytes.  Dots are used to
                     show the dynamically sized part.

6.1.  Fixed Sized Application Data Elements

   type (RZV)
                  The meaning or format of the following text, e.g.
                  plain text, URL.

   size
                  The size of additional data in bytes.

6.2.  Enumerations for Fixed Sized Application Data Elements

6.2.1.  Types

   In combination with certain values of fixed sized header elements,
   'type' may describe application data related to CRN's functionality
   internally.  The relevant specifications are not determined yet.

6.3.  Dynamically Sized Application Data Elements

   The application data contains as many bytes as specified by 'size'.
   According to the 'type' the application data has to be interpreted
   appropriately.  This data is meant normally for applications outside
   the CRN.  By internal routing procedures the applications are the
   nodes of the CRN itself and therefore this data is used, in this
   case, not by applications outside the CRN.

6.4.  Additional Application Data Types

   Depending on the header data additional application data can be used
   for external applications or for the CRNs internally.

6.4.1.  For External Applications

   If additional application data are related to external applications,
   the type of the data and the data itself are the responsibility of
   the external applications exclusively.

6.4.2.  For Internal Use

   The types of additional application data for internal use are not yet
   specified.

7.  Security Considerations

   The use of packets described in this memo has no direct impact on the
   security of the Internet.
