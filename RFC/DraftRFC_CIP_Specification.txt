  Contextinformation Paket (CIP) Specification for Contextinformation
                        Routing Networks (CRNs)
                       CIP Specification for CRNs

Abstract

   Contextinformation Paket (CIP) is the datastructure to transfer
   contextinformation plus header and possibly application data through
   Contextinformation Routing Networks (CRNs).  All information which
   has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be encapsulated within CIPs.
   This document is the specification of CIP.  For an overview about
   CRNs please see Internet-Draft "Concepts of Contextinformation
   Routing Networks (CRNs)" [CRNs].

1.  Introduction

   Contextinformation Packet (CIP) is the datastructure to encapsulate
   encoded CI.  A CIP is divided into three parts:

   Header Data
             The header data concern all metadata not directly related
             to CIC.  The header data starts with a part with fixed size
             and static structure followed by a dynamic part.  The
             static part defines the dynamic part's type and its length.



   Contextinformation
             The Contextinformation starts with a part with fixed size
             and static structure followed by a dynamic part.  The
             static part defines the dynamic part's type and its length.
             The dynamic part consists of CIC-Bricks only.



   Application Data

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs          December 2015


             The application data starts with a part with fixed size and
             static structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static
             part only defines the dynamic part's type and its length.



   All information which has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be
   encapsulated within CIPs.

2.  Motivation

   The motivation for this document is mainly the publication to prevent
   proprietary rights of third parties hindering the general
   availability of its described concepts.  Another additional
   motivation is the exchange with interested experts.  This draft is a
   first step towards a possible formal recognition as an Internet
   Standard in the future.

3.  Zero as Default Value

4.1.  Fix Sized Elements

   sg_request
                  The Service Groups Request shows the relevant
                  service_groups requested by the datagram.  The
                  services which are requested by this datagram have the
                  appropriate bit switched on (see figure 2.1.2).

   sg_profile
                  The Service Groups Profile shows all available service
                  groups of the sender of this datagram.  The services
                  which are available have the appropriate bit switched
                  on (see figure 2.1.2).

   version
                  The version of this specification.  It has a higher
                  4-bit part which represents the major number and a
                  lowere 4-bit part which represents the minor number.

   channel
                  The channel can be used to separate context packet
                  traffic in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.
                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values have no meaning so far.

   UUID
                  The UUID is the unique identifier for the CIP.

   IP address
                  A 32-bit IP address in Network Byte Order.

   IP port
                  A 16-bit port number in Network Byte Order.

   time
                  Unix time of datagram introduction, i.e. the number of
                  seconds between 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 and the
                  moment the CIP arrived in the CRN for the first time.

   dyn_type
                  The type of the following data of the datagram.  The
                  value for the core functionality is 1 which has to be
                  used at the moment.  The value 0 is reserved for
                  testing and all other values have no meaning so far.

   dyn_size

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs          December 2015


                  The size of the following header data of the datagram,
                  i.e. the number of bytes.

   additional data
                  The additional data as specified in type and size.
                  The data for the core functionality is the service_id
                  which has to be used at the moment (see 2.1.2).

4.2.  Enumerations for Fixed Sized Elements

4.2.1.  Service Groups

   'Service Groups' describes the role(s) in CRNs.

   Figure 2.1.2 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2         3  ------------------------------  8
   +---------+---------+---------|----------------------------------+
   | gateway | router  | storage |         not yet defined          |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

   Thus the integer 1 means 'gateway', 2 means 'router' and 3 means both
                               and so forth.

4.2.2.  Channels

   'Channels' describes the separated channels in CRNs.

   Figure 2.1.2 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2  ---------------------------------------   8
   +---------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
   | heartbeat  | routing | application           not yet defined   |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

     Thus the integer 1 means 'client', 2 means 'gateway' and 3 means
                                   both.

4.3.  Dynamic Sized Elements

   dyn_type
                  The type of the following data of the datagram.  The
                  value for the core functionality is 1 which has to be
                  used at the moment.  The value 0 is reserved for
                  testing and all other values have no meaning so far.

   dyn_size

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs          December 2015


                  The size of the following header data of the datagram,
                  i.e. the number of bytes.

   additional data
                  The additional data as specified in type and size.
                  The data for the core functionality is the service_id
                  which has to be used at the moment (see 2.1.2).

4.4.  Additional Types

4.4.1.  Public Key (dyn_type 1)

   Additional header data can be used to transfer authentication data
   like public keys.

   Figure 2.1.2 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2  ---------------------------------------   8
   +---------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
   | client  | gateway |           not yet defined                  |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

     Thus the integer 1 means 'client', 2 means 'gateway' and 3 means
                                   both.

5.  Contextinformation

       Figure 2.2.1 shows the context (brick) section of the context
    datagram.  A context brick consists of two bytes: content und mask.

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   type (1)    |  content (1)  |   mask (1)    |  dyn_size (1) | fix
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+---
   | ............................................................  | |
   | .............. additional data up to 510 bytes .............  | dyn
   | .............. i.e. up to 255 context bricks  ..............  | |
   | ............................................................  | |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

     Field sizes are given in octets.  Fields contain bytes, in normal
   Internet order with the most-significant octet first.  Each tick mark
                            represents one bit.

5.1.  Fixed Sized Elements

   type
                  The type can be used to specify different context
                  designs in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.
                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values has no meaning so far.

   content
                  The content is the first part of a Context Brick (see
                  section 2.4).  It is used in the core functionality to
                  specify the kind of context coding.

   mask
                  The mask is the second part of a Context Brick (see
                  section 2.4).  It is not used in the core
                  functionality so far.

   dyn_size
                  The number of Context Bricks as additional data (up to
                  255).

   additional data
                  The additional data contains the number of Context
                  Bricks (see section 2.4) as specified in dyn_size.

5.2.  Dynamic Sized Elements

   A Context Brick is a pair of bytes in particular content and mask.
   It describes a piece of information and the relevance of its
   exactness.  The meaning of the Context Bricks is not known by the
   Context Network.

   content
                  The content represents an exact information encoded in
                  a byte.

   mask
                  The mask represents the relevance of the exactness of
                  the content in a byte.  For that a 1 makes the
                  corresponding bit of the content irrelevant.  Two bits
                  are corresponding, if they are at the same place in
                  the byte.

6.  Application Data

   The following figure shows the data section of the context datagram.
     This section has no meaning for the Context Routing itself.  The
    meaning of this section is only relevant to the clients.  Therefore
      the following structure has to be seen as a default and can be
     changed, if another specification is agreed between the concerned
   clients.  The 'dyn_size' has to be as if the default structure would
         be actual, i.e. available is then 'dyn_size + 141' bytes.

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   type (1)    |  dyn_size (1) | ............................  | fix
   | ............................................................  | |
   | ........ additional data up to 255 bytes (dyn_size) ........  | dyn
   | ............................................................  | |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

     Field sizes are given in octets.  Fields contain bytes, in normal
   Internet order with the most-significant octet first.  Each tick mark
                            represents one bit.

6.1.  Fixed Sized Elements

   type
                  The meaning or format of the following text, e.g.
                  plain text, URL.

   dyn_size
                  The size of additional data in bytes.

6.2.  Dynamic Sized Elements

   According to the type of the application data as many bytes as
   specified by dyn_size.
