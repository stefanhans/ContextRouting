 Contextinformation Routing (CIR) Specification for Contextinformation
                        Routing Networks (CRNs)
                       CIR Specification for CRNs

Abstract

   Contextinformation Routing (CIR) is routing through
   Contextinformation Routing Networks (CRNs).  For an overview about
   CRNs please see Internet-Draft "Concepts of Contextinformation
   Routing Networks (CRNs)" [CRNs].

1.  Introduction

   The concepts and the implementations should be aware of the following
   patterns as described in the "The Reactive Manifesto" [Manifesto],
   i.e. they should be:

   o  Responsive

   o  Resilient

   o  Elastic

   o  Message Driven

   These aspects will be referred to in the follwing sections.

2.  Motivation

   The motivation for this document is mainly the publication to prevent
   proprietary rights of third parties hindering the general
   availability of its described concepts.  Another additional
   motivation is the exchange with interested experts.  This draft is a
   first step to a possible formal recognition as an Internet Standard
   in the future.

3.  Encoded CI Routing

   introduction

4.  Application's Network Address Updates
